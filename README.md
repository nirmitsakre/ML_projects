# Sentiment Analysis ML
We classify restaurant reviews into "Positive" or "Negative" using Naive Bayes Classification.

The first .tsv contains 900 pre-classified reviews which are used to train and test our model. 
The second .tsv file contains 100 new reviews which we want to classify into "Positive" or "Negative".
